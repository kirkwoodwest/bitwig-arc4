## Bitwig + Arc 4
 Arc4 + Bitwig (Basic Implementation)

---
Super rough implementation to get the 4 arc knobs controlling bitwig with bi-directional control.

This basic extension utilizes a port of @Dewb .js extension. https://github.com/Dewb/bitwig-serialosc-example
Please follow those instructions for getting the extension configured with the arc.

## Touch Osc Template
I am working on a touch osc template here for arc emulation. currently doesn't work completely and need to work out the addresses and how to send/receive array from tosc and bitwig.

## Currently unsupported
- multiple monome devicse
